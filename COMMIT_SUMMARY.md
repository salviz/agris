# Binary Content Handling Implementation

## Summary

This commit adds robust binary content handling to the Agris browser, resolving the previous issues with binary data corruption. Binary files like images, videos, PDFs, and other document types are now properly detected, maintained as buffers (rather than incorrectly converted to strings), and referenced appropriately in the terminal UI.

## Changes

### Added Binary Content Detection
- Added reliable content type detection based on MIME types
- Implemented detection for images, videos, audio, PDFs, documents, etc.
- Created comprehensive mapping of content types to file extensions
- Added binary file extension detection in URLs

### Fixed Buffer Integrity
- Modified request handlers to maintain Buffer objects for binary data
- Prevented corruption of binary data by avoiding UTF-8 encoding for binary content
- Added proper differentiation between text and binary content responses
- Preserved metadata like content size, type, and extension

### Enhanced UI for Binary References
- Added human-readable references like `[Image: URL]`, `[Video: URL]`, etc.
- Implemented descriptive icons for different content types
- Display size, content type, and file extension metadata
- Added clear messaging about binary content limitations in terminal

### HTML Binary Content Extraction
- Enhanced HTML parser to extract and identify binary content references
- Added detection for image, video, audio, and document links
- Implemented separate display section for binary references in rendered output
- Maintained efficient parsing with deduplication and organization

### Testing
- Added binary-test.js to test the implementation
- Verified content type detection for direct binary files
- Tested extraction of binary references from HTML pages
- Confirmed proper handling across various content types

## Benefits
- Terminal users can now see clearly what binary content exists and where to find it
- No more corrupted or garbled output when encountering binary files
- More complete web page representation with binary content references
- Better user experience with appropriate metadata and file information
