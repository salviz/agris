# AGRIS Browser Bugfix Report

## Encoding Issues Fixed

The previous version of AGRIS had significant encoding issues that resulted in garbled output for many websites. This was fixed by implementing the following improvements:

### 1. Enhanced Character Encoding Detection and Handling

- Added the `iconv-lite` library for better character encoding support
- Implemented proper charset detection from HTTP headers and HTML meta tags
- Added fallback mechanisms to try multiple common encodings when the specified encoding fails
- Preserved binary data integrity by working with raw buffers before converting to strings

### 2. Improved Compression Handling

- Added support for multiple compression formats (gzip, deflate, brotli)
- Fixed decompression error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Implemented proper buffer concatenation for more reliable content handling

### 3. Detection Improvements

- Enhanced HTML charset detection from meta tags
- Added support for common charset aliases and normalizations
- Implemented better binary content detection

## Testing Results

The improved version of AGRIS now correctly handles:

- Basic websites like example.com with proper text rendering
- DuckDuckGo search results with proper character encoding
- Some Bing search results, though bot detection remains an issue for many sites

## Remaining Issues

Despite improvements, some challenges remain:

1. **Bot Detection**: Many websites like Google, Stack Overflow, and Reddit still detect AGRIS as a bot and display CAPTCHA or blocking pages
2. **JavaScript-Heavy Sites**: Sites requiring JavaScript execution still don't render properly
3. **Specialized Content**: Some specialized content types might still have rendering issues

## Future Improvements

Recommended future enhancements:

1. **Better Bot Detection Avoidance**:
   - Implement more realistic browser fingerprinting
   - Add rotating user-agents and headers
   - Implement rate limiting and request delays

2. **Expanded Content Support**:
   - Add support for more content types
   - Implement better terminal-friendly output formatting

3. **User Experience**:
   - Add command-line options to customize encoding
   - Add debugging options for troubleshooting

## Usage Tips

- DuckDuckGo works better than Google or Bing for searches
- Simple websites work best
- Use `--raw` option cautiously as it may still have issues with some encodings
