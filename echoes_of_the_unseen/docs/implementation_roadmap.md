## 8. Implementation Roadmap and Considerations
### 8.1. Phase 1: Core Engine and Narrative Backbone (3 Months)
*   **Objective**: Develop the fundamental game engine, core narrative delivery system, and basic AI integrations.
*   **Key Tasks**:
    1.  Set up App Engine environment, FastAPI framework, Firestore database.
    2.  Implement basic player state management (location, inventory - conceptual).
    3.  Integrate high-quality TTS for narration (Google TTS).
    4.  Develop the "Sonic Echoes" mechanic prototype: ability to trigger and play pre-defined "echo" sounds in specific locations.
    5.  Script and implement the first chapter of the narrative, including key locations and plot points.
    6.  Basic voice command recognition for navigation and interaction (e.g., "go north," "examine object").
    7.  Develop initial web-based client for interaction.
    8.  Early accessibility testing: keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility for the client.
*   **AI Focus**: TTS for narration, basic STT for commands.
*   **Outcome**: A playable first chapter demonstrating core gameplay loops and audio-first interaction.

### 8.2. Phase 2: Expanding AI, Sound, and Interactivity (4 Months)
*   **Objective**: Enhance immersion with procedural sound, advanced dialogue, and more complex puzzles.
*   **Key Tasks**:
    1.  Integrate ElevenLabs API for procedural sound effect generation for environments and interactions.
    2.  Begin integration of LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) for:
        *   Dynamic descriptions of non-critical elements.
        *   Contextual hint system.
        *   Simple, dynamic NPC interactions for secondary characters.
    3.  Develop sound-based puzzles that require careful listening and interpretation of "sonic echoes."
    4.  Implement chapters 2 and 3 of the narrative, incorporating branching possibilities based on initial player choices.
    5.  Refine voice command system for more natural language flexibility.
    6.  Flesh out the "Echo Log" / "Sound Journal" feature.
    7.  User testing with blind and visually impaired players; iterate on feedback.
*   **AI Focus**: Procedural SFX, LLM for dynamic content and hints, improved STT.
*   **Outcome**: A significantly more interactive and sonically rich game, with the main storyline playable up to the mid-point.

### 8.3. Phase 3: Narrative Completion, Polish, and Beta Testing (3 Months)
*   **Objective**: Complete the narrative, refine all game systems, and conduct extensive beta testing.
*   **Key Tasks**:
    1.  Implement the final chapters of the narrative, including multiple ending variations based on cumulative player choices and deductions.
    2.  Deepen LLM integration for critical NPC dialogues, ensuring narrative coherence and emotional impact.
    3.  Conduct thorough testing of all narrative branches and puzzle solutions.
    4.  Full accessibility audit and refinement based on WCAG 2.2 AA.
    5.  Performance optimization for AI service calls (caching, asynchronous operations).
    6.  Develop comprehensive onboarding/tutorial.
    7.  Closed beta testing with a wider group of users, including the target audience.
    8.  Refine UI/UX based on beta feedback.
*   **AI Focus**: Advanced LLM for dialogue, STT robustness, overall AI system polish.
*   **Outcome**: A feature-complete, polished game ready for a release candidate.

### 8.4. Phase 4: Launch and Initial Post-Launch Support (2 Months)
*   **Objective**: Deploy the game, market it to the target audience, and provide initial support.
*   **Key Tasks**:
    1.  Final deployment to Google App Engine.
    2.  Prepare promotional materials, focusing on accessibility and unique audio experience.
    3.  Outreach to communities and influencers for blind and visually impaired gamers.
    4.  Monitor system performance and costs.
    5.  Collect user feedback for future improvements.
    6.  Bug fixing and minor updates based on initial feedback.
*   **Outcome**: "Echoes of the Unseen" launched and available to the public.

### 8.5. Key Considerations During Development
*   **Iterative Development**: Regular builds and testing throughout each phase.
*   **User Feedback Integration**: Continuously incorporate feedback from accessibility testers and users.
*   **Modular Design**: Design components (narrative engine, AI connectors, sound manager) to be as modular as possible for easier updates and maintenance.
*   **Cost Monitoring**: Keep a close eye on AI service usage and GAE costs, especially during testing phases.
*   **Documentation**: Maintain internal documentation for code, narrative design, and AI prompt strategies.
