## 7. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) for Non-Visual Play
The UI/UX for "Echoes of the Unseen" will be meticulously designed to support an audio-first experience, ensuring intuitive interaction for blind and visually impaired players.

### 7.1. Core Principles for Non-Visual UI/UX
*   **Clarity and Consistency**: All audio cues, prompts, and feedback mechanisms will be clear, concise, and consistently applied throughout the game.
*   **Player Agency and Control**: Players will have control over the pace of information, ability to replay audio, and easily access help or current game status.
*   **Minimal Cognitive Load**: Avoid overwhelming the player with too much auditory information at once. Information will be layered and presented contextually.
*   **Immersive Feedback**: Audio feedback should not just inform but also immerse the player in the game world. Spatial audio and rich sound design are key.

### 7.2. Navigational Model (Conceptual)
*   **Scene-Based Exploration**: The game world will be divided into distinct "scenes" or "locations."
*   **Directional Navigation (Audio Cues)**:
    *   When entering a new scene, the narrator describes the key features and potential exits/points of interest. "You are in a dusty study. You hear the gentle ticking of a grandfather clock to your North, a rustling of papers from a desk to your East, and the faint sound of rain against a window to your West. A heavy oak door is South, leading back to the hallway."
    *   Players can use commands like "Go North," "Examine Desk," "Listen towards the window."
    *   Spatial audio will reinforce the location of these points of interest.
*   **"Points of Interest" Interaction**:
    *   Within a scene, specific objects or elements can be interacted with.
    *   Commands like "Examine [object]," "Listen to [object]," "Use [item] on [object]."
*   **Simplified World Representation**: The world doesn't need to be a geometrically accurate map. It's a collection of interconnected nodes (scenes) with described exits and interactable elements.

### 7.3. Information Hierarchy and Delivery
*   **Narrator as Primary Guide**: The narrator provides descriptions, sets the scene, and gives feedback on actions.
*   **Layered Audio Information**:
    *   **Ambient Soundscape**: Continuous background audio defining the environment (e.g., library ambiance, street noise).
    *   **Key Sound Events**: Specific sounds related to player actions or game events (e.g., opening a door, a clue-related sound).
    *   **Narration & Dialogue**: Delivered clearly over the soundscape.
*   **"Status Check" Command**: Player can ask "Where am I?" or "What can I do?" to get a summary of the current scene and available actions.
*   **"Sound Journal" / "Echo Log"**: An in-game system (accessed via voice command, e.g., "Open Echo Log") where key clues, character notes, and summaries of "sonic echoes" are stored and can be reviewed by the player. This helps manage cognitive load and track progress.

### 7.4. Onboarding and Tutorial
*   **Interactive Tutorial**: The game will start with a guided tutorial sequence that introduces core mechanics: navigation, interaction, listening for echoes, voice commands, and using the Echo Log.
*   **Gradual Introduction of Complexity**: New abilities or interaction types will be introduced progressively.
*   **Contextual Help**: Tips or reminders can be offered if the player seems stuck or repeatedly tries invalid commands. "Remember, you can say 'examine [object]' to learn more."
The UI/UX aims to make interaction feel natural and empowering, allowing players to become fully absorbed in the role of "The Listener."
