## 4. Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA and WCAG 3.0 Compliance
Accessibility is not an afterthought but a foundational principle for "Echoes of the Unseen." The game is designed primarily for blind users, but will also cater to visually impaired and sighted players interested in audio-first experiences.

### 4.1. Core Accessibility Principles
*   **Audio First, Not Audio Only (Optionally)**: While the primary experience is auditory, visual elements (like subtitles, transcripts, or visualizations of sound) can be offered as secondary support for players who can use them, without being necessary for gameplay.
*   **Comprehensive Keyboard Navigation**: All interactions must be achievable via keyboard using standard navigation patterns (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow Keys).
*   **Screen Reader Compatibility**: The game interface (if any web-based menus or launchers are used) will be fully compatible with major screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver). Game content itself will be self-voicing via high-quality TTS.
*   **Clear and Distinguishable Audio Cues**: Sound effects for UI elements, game events, and environmental details will be designed to be easily distinguishable and contextually clear. Spatial audio will be used to enhance immersion and convey location.
*   **Adjustable Audio Levels**: Independent volume controls for narration, dialogue, sound effects, and background ambiance.
*   **Pacing and Cognitive Load**: The game will allow players to control the pace of narration and information flow. Complex information will be presented in manageable chunks. Options to repeat instructions or narrative segments will be available.
*   **Multiple Modalities for Input**: Voice commands (primary for immersion), keyboard (robust backup), and potentially touch/gestures on compatible devices.

### 4.2. WCAG Guideline Adherence
The project will strive for WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance for any web-based interfaces and will incorporate principles from the upcoming WCAG 3.0 (W3C Accessibility Guidelines) where applicable, particularly concerning audio content and interactive experiences.

**Key WCAG 2.2 Areas of Focus:**
| Guideline                                     | Application to "Echoes of the Unseen"                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 1.1 Text Alternatives                         | Not primary, but any visual text (e.g., on a website) will have alternatives. Game content is audio.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 1.2 Time-based Media                          | Pre-recorded audio will have transcripts. AI-generated dynamic audio will have real-time captioning/subtitling options.

### 4.3. Accessibility Testing
*   **Automated Testing**: For web interfaces, tools like Axe or WAVE will be used.
*   **Manual Testing**: Iterative testing with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).
*   **User Testing with Target Audience**: Crucially, the game will be tested by blind and visually impaired users throughout the development process. Feedback from these sessions will be integral to design and refinement. This includes testing for clarity of audio descriptions, intuitiveness of controls, and overall engagement.
*   **Accessibility Audits**: Potential for a third-party accessibility audit before major releases.
This multi-faceted approach ensures that "Echoes of the Unseen" is not just playable, but truly enjoyable and immersive for its target audience.
